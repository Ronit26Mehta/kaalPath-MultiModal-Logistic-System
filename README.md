## üßÆ **Mathematical Models and Algorithms**

KaalPath's optimization relies on a suite of mathematical models and algorithms tailored for logistics. Below is a detailed breakdown with LaTeX formatting using the ` ```math ` style:

### **Shipment Risk and Time Factors**
- **Risk Factor (\( R_f \))**  
  ```math
  R_f = \frac{W}{V + 1} \times \delta \quad \text{where} \quad \delta \sim U(0.9, 1.3)
  ```  
  - **Purpose**: Quantifies shipment risk based on weight (\( W \)) and volume (\( V \)), with a random perturbation (\( \delta \)) for realism.

- **Time Factor (\( T_f \))**  
  ```math
  T_f = \max(1, \text{Days}(\text{Shipping Date} - \text{Current Date}))
  ```  
  - **Purpose**: Measures urgency, ensuring time-sensitive shipments are prioritized.

### **Route Segment Evaluation**
- **Efficiency (\( \eta \))**  
  ```math
  \eta = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Transit Time} + 1}
  ```  
  - **Purpose**: Assesses segment performance, balancing speed and distance.

- **Safety (\( S \))**  
  ```math
  S = \max(0, 100 - 0.12 \times \text{Cost} + \epsilon) \quad \text{where} \quad \epsilon \sim U(-5, 5)
  ```  
  - **Purpose**: Evaluates safety by factoring in cost and random variability (\( \epsilon \)).

- **Sustainability Factor (\( \sigma \))**  
  ```math
  \sigma = \left( \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Cost} + 1} \right) \times \left( \frac{S}{100} \right)
  ```  
  - **Purpose**: Measures environmental impact, promoting greener routes.

### **Overall Route Metrics**
For a route with \( N \) segments:
- **Overall Efficiency (\( \eta_{\text{overall}} \))**  
  ```math
  \eta_{\text{overall}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \text{Distance}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N \text{Transit Time}_i}
  ```  
- **Feasibility (\( F \))**  
  ```math
  F = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N S_i
  ```  
- **Sustainability Index (\( S_{\text{index}} \))**  
  ```math
  S_{\text{index}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i
  ```  
  - **Purpose**: Aggregates segment metrics to evaluate entire routes comprehensively.

### **Resilience and Innovation Metrics**
- **Resilience Factor (\( R \))**  
  ```math
  R = \frac{0.6 \times R_f + 0.4 \times F}{T_f + 1}
  ```  
  - **Purpose**: Combines risk and feasibility, adjusted for time urgency, to measure route robustness.

- **Innovation Score (\( I \))**  
  ```math
  I = 0.4 \times Q + 0.3 \times \sigma + 0.3 \times R
  ```  
  - **Purpose**: Integrates predicted quality (\( Q \)), sustainability, and resilience for a forward-looking metric.

### **Deep Learning Prediction**
- **Route Quality (\( Q \))**  
  ```math
  Q = \tanh \left( \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b \right)
  ```  
  - **Feature Vector (\( \mathbf{x} \))**:  
    ```math
    \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} \text{Total Distance} & \text{Total Cost} & \text{Total Time} & F \end{bmatrix}^T
    ```  
  - **Purpose**: Predicts route quality using a neural network with weights (\( \mathbf{w} \)) and bias (\( b \)).

### **Quantum Annealing Optimization**
- **Process**: Iteratively perturbs candidate routes, evaluating quality scores with slight randomness to mimic quantum annealing and escape local optima.
- **Purpose**: Identifies globally optimal routes efficiently.

### **Fuzzy Logic Ranking**
- **Fuzzy Score (\( s_{\text{fuzzy}} \))**  
  ```math
  s_{\text{fuzzy}} = Q + \Delta \quad \text{where} \quad \Delta \sim U(-5, 5)
  ```  
  - **Purpose**: Introduces uncertainty into rankings, enhancing robustness by adding a random perturbation (\( \Delta \)) to the predicted route quality (\( Q \)).

These models collectively ensure routes are optimized across multiple dimensions, making KaalPath a versatile framework.
